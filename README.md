## Introduction

As per the Indian constitution, there are 22 official languages of India including Hindi,
Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Bodo, Malayalam, Sanskrit, etc. According
to the 2011 census, Hindi is the mother tongue of around 40% Indians. Thus, most
Indians have a mother tongue other than Hindi.
If you are trying to learn to speak a language at your own pace, then you can use apps
like Duolingo, Mango languages, Busuu, etc to do so. There are options easily available
to learn Hindi, but it’s not the same for other Indian languages, especially not one like
Duolingo.
Thus, anyone wanting to learn an Indian language in an easy and fun manner would like
to have access to an app like “MorBol”.
MorBol, that stands for ‘Mor’ (peacock, i.e., the national bird or ‘More’) and ‘Bol’
(words), is a user-friendly Indian language learning app with the following features:
1. Structured learning courses with questions for regular assessment through
verbal, listening and reading practice.
2. Sets up daily goals for the user to achieve, encouraging them to take small steps
at a comfortable pace and keeps them interested. The user is also notified as a
reminder for the same.
3. Option of conversing with a chatbot and joining communities to help the user in
improving their communication skills in that language, since conversation builds
better understanding of any language.
4. Gamified quiz to compete with other learners and practice.
5. Feedback option to register a complaint, query or provide feedback about the
usage of the app or course.
6. App language options in Indian languages other than English for
accommodating a larger diverse audience.
In the wake of the disappearance of languages around the world, it is imminent for us
to conserve and propagate the use of our native languages. This app aims to aid the same
goal and make the process of learning an Indian language fun!
