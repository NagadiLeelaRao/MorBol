# 🇮🇳 MorBol: The Indian Languages Learning App

_Note:_ This is a purely **Software Engineering** based Academic project.

## Introduction

India's rich linguistic tapestry is recognized by the Constitution, which lists **22 official languages**, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Punjabi, Malayalam, Sanskrit, and others. The 2011 census revealed that Hindi is the mother tongue for approximately 40% of Indians, meaning a significant majority has a native language other than Hindi.

While resources like Duolingo, Mango languages, and Busuu offer extensive options for learning languages like Hindi, comparable, high-quality, and gamified options are scarce for many other Indian regional languages.

**MorBol** aims to fill this gap. Anyone seeking a fun, engaging, and easy way to learn an Indian language will find their solution here.
